Want to leverage YOLO object detection for safety?

One great implementation is using it to determine when drivers might be feeling a little drowsy. In this project weâ€™re going to do exactly that using a fine tuned, customer object detection model powered by YOLO and PyTorch!

In this project we will: 
1. Instal Ultralytics YOLOv5
2. Detect Objects from Images
3. Detect Objects from Pre-Recorded Videos
4. Detect Objects in Real Time Using OpenCV
5. Fine Tuning a Drowsiness Model using YOLOv5 and PyTorch
6. Perform Real Time Drowsiness Detection
